# Mall Customer Segmentation - Improved Version 🚀

## 📌 Introduction
This project performs customer segmentation using clustering algorithms such as **KMeans**. The goal is to segment customers based on spending patterns and shopping behavior.

## 📊 Data Preprocessing
- Checked for **missing values**.
- Scaled numerical features using **StandardScaler** to improve clustering performance.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Pairplot:** Shows relationships between features.
- **Heatmap:** Displays feature correlations.

## ⚙️ Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Used **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine optimal clusters.
- Implemented **KMeans clustering** with optimal parameters.

## 🔍 Results & Insights
- Identified key customer segments.
- Visualized clusters to understand spending behavior.

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Implement additional clustering techniques (e.g., Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN).
- Improve customer insights with more feature engineering.
